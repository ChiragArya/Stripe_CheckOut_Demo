# Stripe Basics

This project illustrates how to manage payments in a Rails 4 application using [Stripe.com](http://stripe.com) service.

This is divided in three branches: 'master', 'checkout', 'cards', 'recurring', 'coupons' and 'marketplace'. Each branch corresponds with one 'Tealeaf academy' article:

* ["Stripe Checkout for Rails"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/stripe-checkout): Adding just one button and go. Corresponds with **[checkout]** branch.
* ["Stripe.js for payments with credit cards"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/stripe-js): Creating our form to accept Credit card Payments using our own form. Corresponds with **[cards]** branch.
* ["Recurring Payments With Stripe"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/stripe-recurring): Here both payment methods in the first articles are adapted to process recurring payments. Corresponds with **[recurring]** branch.
* ["Stripe coupons"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/stripe-coupons): Add the possibility to accept promotional discount coupos from your cliens. Corresponds with **[coupons]** branch.
* ["Stripe.js for payments with credit cards"](http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/stripe-marketplace): Act as an intermediary service between your clients and their customers. Corresponds with **[marketplace]** branch.

**[master]** branch corresponds with the basic application without payment processor. Very useful if you wish to try this article series by yourself in local.

Enjoy!
